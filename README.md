## Description

This is a simple counter made exclusively with Javascript. 
No elements were written to the index.html file. 
Only the links for the font, the css page and the Open Graph metadata have been written in the <head> tag.

The elements displayed on the screen were all written in the script.js file by modifying the DOM with the document.createElement() method.
The addEventListener() method has been applied to the "+", "-" and "reset" buttons to invoke functions on "click".

## Instruction

Press the "+" button to increase the count by 1.
Press the "-" button to decrease the count by 1.

The count does not go negative unless the dedicated checkbox is selected.
Otherwise an error message will appear.


You can select a checkbox to increase the count by 10 at a time.

The reset button clears the count, deselects checkboxes and clears error messages.

## How to install

To open the project you only need a browser and an internet connection.
